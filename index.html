									<p>Stapled noise is a not-for-profit publication reflecting Ōtepoti’s current alternative music scene - a handbook guide to the scene for students and creatives new to Dunedin. This will be mass-distributed across the local university campus, as well as the venues and cafes, to be accessible for anyone who comes across it.
										<br><br>
										
										This project is created, designed and edited by Ash McFarlane, an up-and-coming Dunedin graphic designer with a goal to merge the aesthetics of local music and the DIY zine ethos. He has partnered up with Radio One, utilising aligning kaupapa and values to advocate for local students and creatives. 
										<br><br>
										
										Otepoti's music has always been a prominent part of the culture, but right now it is making a spectacular comeback, with some describing it as the next Dunedin Sound. Recently everything has been lining up with the return of the punk/grunge tone, the all ages scene, and the passion is growing. It is is the perfect time for a free and accessible zine to reflect what is happening right now. There is a big disconnect with Dunedin students/newcomers understanding of the alternative music scene, so this project will offer the solution to spread creative voices and spaces. 
										<br><br>
										For this project to make an impact on Dunedin, it needs to be printed. Stapled Noise is 100% dependent on fundraising to be printed, as it will not create any monetary profit. Whatever money that can be made will go directly to covering production costs, which includes the paper stock, printing, trimming and binding. Ash is not a musician, so he is putting his all into this design project to give back to Dunedin's music scene.
										<br><br>
										Stapled Noise has the responsibility to uplift voices of all backgrounds and cultures, in a way that physically connects to a diverse range of communities.
										<br><br>
										This project aims to embed an understanding of enhancing Mauri, the energy and creative passion that is much of Ōtepoti’s driving life force. The balance of strengthening connections and nurturing wellbeing through creative expression. 
										<br><br>
										This work needs to be seen, heard, and experienced because it captures the heart of Ōtepoti’s alternative scene, advocating for the people and spaces who make it thrive. 
										<br><br>
										The goal of this project is to create free and accessible copies. If you care about this culture, this project depends on you.

                            <Strong class="handbook-heading">About Me</Strong><br>Ash McFarlane<br><i>Creative, Graphic Designer, Loving Father</i><br><br>
							I moved to Dunedin in 2023 to study like everyone else straight outta’ high school. I didn’t know a soul, and I felt kinda lost. My flatmate at the time, who is respectfully my token ‘basic bitch’ friend (she said I could say that), took me to the same clubs every weekend with all her girlfriends. It didn’t take too long for me to realise that it wasn't my thing as an awkward twinky-looking man in my Pixies phase. Later, I finally worked up the courage to befriend a mysterious dude in my class, whom at the time I only knew as “band t-shirt guy”. <br>
							He introduced me to the local scene, taking me out to gigs and parties where I met a bunch of musos, and at the time I thought these were the coolest people ever – I later realised they were just kinda cool. Nonetheless, I made it my goal to become the biggest groupie known to man, to the point of going on a nationwide tour with a band I wasn’t even in (r.i.p Dud Uglys), but it was a lotta fun. I am so glad to have infiltrated this wonderful community. 
							<br><br>
							I am not a musician, but I am reasonably skilled in design, so I decided that’d by my way to contribute to the scene. I continue to create gig posters for local bands, and attempting to capture the loud, organised-chaotic energy that the alternative scene offers within a design context has definitely helped me improve my ways. So now, if you’re reading this, I took it a step further to create a zine that captures everything I love about Dunedin – the community I’ve become a part of. 
							<br><br>
							This project is created for 2023 me, a zine that will introduce you to what Ōtepoti’s music scene has to offer, addressing the disconnect that newcomers have who may get trapped in that ‘uni-scene’ with no way to venture past DropKicks and mesh with the more local ‘alternative scene’. And just to preface, I think that the distinction between these two titles is a bit dumb – bands are here to play music and enjoy the scene, which is so great. Especially for first years, I think it’s important to experience a heap of different gigs to see where your heart lies.
